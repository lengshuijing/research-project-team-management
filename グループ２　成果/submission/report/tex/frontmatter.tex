\begin{abstract}
	This paper introduces the Chain-of-Command Framework (CoCF), a language and
	framework for coordinating Large Language Model (LLM) agents in a hierarchical
	structure. Inspired by military hierarchies, CoCF aims to improve the
	efficiency and effectiveness of LLM agents in complex tasks by establishing
	clear roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols within a
	hierarchical structure. CoCF addresses limitations of current LLM agents, such
	as hallucination and limited context windows, by enabling specialized agents to
	collaborate and reason collectively. The paper details the design and
	implementation of the CoCF language, including its syntax, semantics, and communication
	protocols, incorporating principles from the AGILE and MOA frameworks. It also
	presents a prototype system with different LLM agents interacting within the CoCF
	hierarchy and discusses potential applications, challenges, and future research
	directions.
